# SearchingAlgorithms
This Python project demonstrates the implementation of graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS) to calculate and analyze traversal orderings and total costs in a graph. The program processes input data to build a graph, performs traversals, and computes costs for specific paths.
